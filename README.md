**Spotify** playlist to **youtube** playlist converter

---
***WORK IN PROGRESS***

>A basic web app allowing for a user to convert, or replicate, their spotify playlists into Youtube playlists.

>The user should be able to log into their spotify accounts from the page using the secure spotify api authentication endpoints. Once authenticated, the users playlists will be returned to them in a list format, allowing for them to choose one they would like to have replicated onto youtube.

>For each item in the playlist, the application will attempt to find the matching audio / videos and add it to an unlisted playlist which then will be provided to them via a secure link.
